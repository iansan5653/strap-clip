## Backpack Strap Clip

A simple 3d printed clip to hold long backpack straps so they don't flap around.

![Picture of the clips in use. They are shaped like an elongated "C" and will hold three layers of webbing together.](./photo.jpg)

This model fits about three layers of 1-inch wide straps. It prints in under 10 minutes - I used PETG but PLA would probably work just fine.

![Dimensioned drawing of the part. The clip is a 1/16 inch thick by 1/4 inch wide strip of plastic bent into a long C shape with semicircular ends. The shape has a maximum internal length of 1 inch, an internal height of 1/4 inch, and a 1/2 inch wide opening.](./drawing.PNG)
